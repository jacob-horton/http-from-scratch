This is an HTTP server, which I have used to learn the HTTP spec, and perform a bit of parsing.

It does not cover the whole HTTP spec, and should not be used in production.

# Structure

- `lib` is where the library code is - this is the actual implementation of the HTTP server
- `src` includes an example echo server
